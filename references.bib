% MOVABLE SINKS 
% One idea is to have a movable sink controlled by a reinforced learning algorithm which would move the sink to the
% optimal place based on where energy harvest/state of charge is at its highest. Since clustering ought to be most dense
% there, see https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1155/2015/618072.
