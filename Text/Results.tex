\textit{In this chapter the results from the simulations and tests of both the MPC controller and the RL controller will be depicted and the performance will be matched against each other.}

\section{Model Based Controller}

Average computation time per control step for each node at about 0.04s
Average computation time per control step for 2nd layer at about 0.3s


\section{Data Driven Controller}
 This section will present the results from the tests on the data driven controller. The energy consumed, rounds survived and data packets sent will be depicted for all selected explorations rates and compared with LEACH for two different cases. These two cases will be clarified in the following subsections.  

\subsection{Identical CH Generation}
% Explain this test
In the first test with decaying the exploration rates were set to
